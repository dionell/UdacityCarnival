This is my first VR project. Udacity Carnival is a game that is composed of 3 mini-games, and getting 2000 scores will get you a stuffed toy. Upon starting the application, select "start game" to play the game. You will have 45 seconds to get 2000 scores or all of your scores will reset to 0. Have fun!
